  <p>Autoscriber is a progressive web app (PWA) that listens to your microphone audio, transcribes your speech, and summarizes your meeting in bullet point format. During the meeting, participants simply open a session link and turn on their microphone. Once the meeting is over, Autoscriber will use AI language models to analyze the conversation and jot down important sentences automatically.</p>
